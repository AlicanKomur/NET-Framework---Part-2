📘 C# Portfolio Assignments

Author: Alican Komür

This repository contains multiple C#/.NET projects created to practice fundamental and intermediate programming concepts. Each assignment demonstrates topics such as object-oriented programming, interfaces, operator overloading, and polymorphism.

📂 Project Files
1. Polymorphism.cs

Repository: Polymorphism Assignment
Description:
This project demonstrates polymorphism in C#. The Employee class implements the IQuittable interface, which defines a Quit() method. In the main program, an Employee object is treated as an IQuittable type, and the Quit() method is called to show how polymorphism allows objects to be referenced by their interface.

Key Concepts:

Polymorphism

Interfaces

Method Implementation

2. Operator Assignment.cs

Repository: Operators Assignment
Description:
This project focuses on operator overloading. The Employee class overloads the == and != operators so two Employee objects can be compared using their Id values. The Equals() and GetHashCode() methods are also overridden to ensure consistent behavior across comparisons.

Key Concepts:

Operator Overloading

Overriding Methods

Object Comparison
